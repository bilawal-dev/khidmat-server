# Khidmat — Server

Agentic backend for the Khidmat AI service orchestrator. Takes a natural-language request, classifies the user's intent, runs a LangGraph state machine with Gemini-backed tools, and streams the trace back to the mobile client as Server-Sent Events.

Stateless re: bookings — the mobile app is the source of truth. The server emits `booking_update` / `booking_cancel` / `booking_query` events as *intents*; the FE validates and applies them.

## Stack

## Local development

Prerequisites: Node 20, npm, a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

```powershell
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set GEMINI_API_KEY
npm install
npm run dev
```

Server starts on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

### Scripts

| Script | What |
|--------|------|
| `npm run dev` | `tsx watch` — auto-reloads on change |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run build` | Compile to `dist/` |
| `npm start` | Run compiled `dist/index.js` |

## Environment variables

| Var | Required | Default | Purpose |
|-----|----------|---------|---------|
| `PORT` | yes | — | HTTP port. Server exits if missing or invalid. |
| `TZ` | recommended | host default | Schedule math uses local time; set to `Asia/Karachi` for correct Pakistan timestamps. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | yes | — | Google AI Studio key. |
| `GEMINI_MODEL_NAME` | yes | — | e.g. `gemini-2.0-flash`. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | no | all origins | Comma-separated CORS allowlist. Unset = permissive. |

All required vars are validated once on boot in [src/config/env.ts](src/config/env.ts); the server fails fast with a clear message if any is missing or invalid.

## API

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| GET | `/health` | — | `{ success: true, message: 'Health Check Passed', data: { status: 'ok', uptimeSeconds } }` |
| POST | `/chat` | see below | SSE stream of `AgentEvent` |

### `POST /chat` request body

```ts
{
  message: string,            // user input, any language; 1-2000 chars
  sessionId?: string,         // FE-generated UUID per chat thread
  defaultLocation?: string,   // sector from FE settings, e.g. 'G-13'
  bookings?: Booking[],       // FE's persisted bookings, sent every request
}
```

Booking shape: [src/schemas/booking.ts](src/schemas/booking.ts).

### `POST /chat` event stream

All events declared in [src/agent/events.ts](src/agent/events.ts).

| Event | When |
|-------|------|
| `thought` | Agent narration, interleaved across all flows |
| `understanding` | Extracted service / location / time for a new booking |
| `searching` | Looking up providers by category and sector |
| `ranking` | Scoring candidates by haversine distance and rating |
| `recommendation` | Top pick with reasoning + suggested slot |
| `awaiting_user` | Pause and ask; resend with same `sessionId` to resume |
| `booking` | Selecting provider + slot |
| `confirmed` | Booking ID generated |
| `reminder_scheduled` | Reminder offset set |
| `booking_update` | Intent: mutate an existing booking |
| `booking_cancel` | Intent: cancel an existing booking |
| `booking_query` | Intent: answer a question about an existing booking |

## Agent architecture

`classify_intent` (Gemini structured-output) routes each request into one of four branches:

- **new_booking** → `intent_extraction` → `gate` (interrupts if service/location/time missing) → `newBookingAgent` ↔ `tools`
- **modify_booking** → `modifyAgent` ↔ `tools`
- **cancel_booking** → `cancelAgent` ↔ `tools`
- **query_booking** → `queryAgent` ↔ `tools`

Each branch has its own bound toolset and system prompt. The shared `tools` node executes the call and `routeAfterTools` returns to the calling branch's agent.

### Tools

Defined in [src/agent/tools.ts](src/agent/tools.ts).

| Tool | Branch | Emits |
|------|--------|-------|
| `searchProviders` | new | `searching` |
| `rankByDistance` | new | `ranking` |
| `checkAvailability` | new | — |
| `confirmBooking` | new | `recommendation`, `booking`, `confirmed` |
| `scheduleReminder` | new | `reminder_scheduled` |
| `resolveBookingTarget` | modify, cancel, query | — |
| `proposeBookingChange` | modify | `booking_update` |
| `proposeBookingCancellation` | cancel | `booking_cancel` |
| `answerBookingQuery` | query | `booking_query` |

### Multi-turn

Sessions are keyed by `sessionId` and held in memory by LangGraph's `MemorySaver`, evicted after 1 hour idle. The graph pauses (via `GraphInterrupt`) in two cases:

1. `gate` detects missing fields on a new booking.
2. `resolveBookingTarget` returns an empty `bookingId` (ambiguous or no match) in modify / cancel / query.

In both cases the FE receives `awaiting_user` and resumes by re-posting with the same `sessionId`.

## State / persistence

The server **does not persist bookings**. The FE owns them in AsyncStorage and sends the array on every `/chat` request. The array is injected into `RunnableConfig.configurable.bookings` so tools and agent nodes can read it. The agent emits booking mutations as intents; the FE validates and applies them.

Only in-flight conversational state (LangGraph checkpoints per session) is persisted, and that's in-memory and idle-evicted. No database required.

## Multilingual

Gemini handles Urdu, Roman Urdu, English, and mixed-language inputs natively. `awaiting_user` clarifications are English-only — known limitation.

## Limitations

- 15-entry mock provider catalog for Islamabad sectors only. No real Maps API integration.
- Reminders are emitted as intents; the FE schedules the local notification. No push/SMS infra.
- No authentication; single anonymous session.
- No rate limiting. Gemini quota is the choke point.
- Sessions evict after 1h idle; multi-turn flows resume within that window only.
- Timezone hardcoded to `Asia/Karachi`. Multi-region would need a `sector → tz` lookup.
- `resolveBookingTarget` serializes the full bookings payload into a Gemini prompt for disambiguation. Acceptable for mock data; would need redaction if real PII were added.
- Reminder offset is hardcoded to `1 hour before`.

## How Antigravity was used

Google Antigravity was the AI coding assistant that wrote the agent code (graph, tools, route handlers, schemas) from prescriptive prompts authored by the developer. Build-time only — Antigravity is not part of the runtime; the runtime is LangGraph + Gemini. Prompt history: [docs/antigravity-prompts/](docs/antigravity-prompts/).
